# v0.0.5
* Server now does a protocol version check. If your version doesn't match, you are kicked.
* Added support for multiple realms on the server. This makes it so different stages are actually different stages.
* Fixed join/leave announcements so they don't show every time a player dies.

## Sonic Frontiers
* Added support for the following game modes:
  * Battle Rush
  * Boss Rush
  * CyberStage Challenge
